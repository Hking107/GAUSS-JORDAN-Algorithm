#GAUSS-JORDAN Elimination algorithm
A simple C programm that helps transform a matrix to it's Reduced Echelon Form. 
A base for solving equations of the form Ax=B, solving for X when A and B are given.
A is a matrix, X and B are vectors.

Just compile the C program normally on the terminal: `gcc Pivot.c -o <exeName>`
Then run <exeName>: `./<exeName>`
